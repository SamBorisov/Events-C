# Event Factory

Front-End - `https://github.com/SamBorisov/Events-FE` 

### This project consists of 2 contracts:
- Marketplace.sol: a proxy factory that deploys a new event contract with specific details and sets the sender of the function as the owner of the new contract.
- Event.sol: saves event details, allows users to buy tickets at a specific price, choose a lucky winner at the end of the event, and allows the owner to withdraw their profit from the sale.

- Click the "Balance" button to see your ticket balance. Choose a number for the number of tickets you want to buy and press the "Buy Tickets" button. You can see the current and end time by clicking on the "BTN current and end time". After the sale ends, you can call "Get Lucky Winner" and see the lucky winner's address after it was chosen. (there should be at least 1 bought ticket)
- If you encounter problems with the blocks number (change the network then go again to localhost) or nonce, reset your Metamask account from settings/advanced.<br>
